# Daria's Advent of Code Solution Repo
Welcome! I started this Repo to keep track of my Advent of Code practices. I started this in 2023, but plan to solve other year's problems as well.

The ultimate goal is to have good, readable, tested solutions for every challenge, but I might still need to refactor or add tests to some!
The road to perfect code is never-ending!

## 2023 Advent of Code
I decided to write it in Ruby and test in Rspec. 
Debug is my debugger of choice. 
Check out the Bundler Gemfile for more details.
